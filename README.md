## Overview of the UFO Challenge
The purpose of this challenge was to create an informative and intuitive webpage for people who are curious to see actual UFO sightings data gathered from all over the US. We were tasked with adding additional search options for the end user to use to gather specific data in addition to the original "search by date" option. The additional script provided in-depth analysis of the data and gave the end user more flexibility when searching multiple criteria. These included adding filters for city, state country and shape of the object seen at the time of the sighting. 

## Summary
  Drawback of this webpage

  The input fields are case-sensitive and will not give any output results unless all (date, city, state, country, and shape) are exactly the way it has been wrtiten.
  The following are recommendations for further development:

    1. Add another drop-down menu that will help futher drill down to desired results.
    2. Enable an autofill mechanism or enable "one" button autofill at the initial input phase. 
    3. Adding released government declassified UFO intel to further enhance the experience and add a real possibility that we are not alone out there.
